# Open Notebook

A private, multi-model, 100% local, full-featured alternative to Notebook LM

In a world dominated by Artificial Intelligence, having the ability to think 🧠 and acquire new knowledge 💡, is a skill that should not be a privilege for a few, nor restricted to a single provider.

### How Open Notebook Works

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Your Browser                                           │
│  Access: http://your-server-ip:8502                     │
└────────────────┬────────────────────────────────────────┘
                 │
                 ▼
         ┌───────────────┐
         │   Port 8502   │  ← Next.js Frontend (what you see)
         │   Frontend    │    Also proxies API requests internally!
         └───────┬───────┘
                 │ proxies /api/* requests ↓
                 ▼
         ┌───────────────┐
         │   Port 5055   │  ← FastAPI Backend (handles requests)
         │     API       │
         └───────┬───────┘
                 │
                 ▼
         ┌───────────────┐
         │   SurrealDB   │  ← Database (internal, auto-configured)
         │   (Port 8000) │
         └───────────────┘
```

**Key Points:**
- **v1.1+**: Next.js automatically proxies `/api/*` requests to the backend, simplifying reverse proxy setup
- Your browser loads the frontend from port 8502
- The frontend needs to know where to find the API - when accessing remotely, set: `API_URL=http://your-server-ip:5055`
- **Behind reverse proxy?** You only need to proxy to port 8502 now! See [Reverse Proxy Guide](docs/deployment/reverse-proxy.md)
